# Project on Smart Fan using Ardunio 

The smart fan project utilizes temperature and humidity sensors to automatically adjust fan speed for optimal comfort. 
By integrating these sensors, the fan can dynamically respond to changes in environmental conditions, ensuring 
efficient and personalized airflow in any room. Through a user-friendly interface, individuals can also customize 
settings and monitor real-time data for enhanced comfort and energy efficiency.

## Description

The DHT22 sensor communicates with microcontrollers using a custom 40-bit single-wire digital protocol. It initiates 
communication with a start signal, followed by the transmission of temperature, humidity, and checksum bits. The 
microcontroller decodes the data, performs a checksum verification, and converts the raw readings into physical units. 
This reliable protocol enables accurate temperature and humidity monitoring in diverse applications.
